# Install MiniCPM-V Apps

**English** | [中文](DOWNLOAD_zh.md)

Pre-built apps for **iOS**, **Android**, and **HarmonyOS NEXT** are listed below. All three apps run the MiniCPM-V multimodal model fully **on-device** via `llama.cpp` — no remote server, no data leaves your phone.

> Looking to build from source instead? See the main [README](README.md).

## iOS — TestFlight

**Public link:** [https://testflight.apple.com/join/yNKyFZwW](https://testflight.apple.com/join/yNKyFZwW)

> **Heads up — iOS ships slower than Android / HarmonyOS.**
> Every iOS build has to clear Apple's TestFlight review before it reaches users, so new features and bug fixes on iOS typically land **several days to a couple of weeks behind** the Android APK and HarmonyOS HAP releases. If you need the latest fix immediately, please use the Android or HarmonyOS package on this page.

### Requirements

* iPhone or iPad running **iOS / iPadOS 16 or later**
* Recommended: a device with ≥ 6 GB RAM (e.g. iPhone 15 Pro / iPad with M-series chip) for smooth on-device inference
* The TestFlight app installed from the App Store

### How to install

1. Install **TestFlight** from the App Store on your iPhone or iPad.
2. Open the public link above on the same device, then tap **Accept** → **Install**.
3. Launch **MiniCPM-V Demo** from the Home Screen and follow the in-app prompts to download the model files.

> Each TestFlight build is valid for up to 90 days. When a new build is published, TestFlight will notify you.
