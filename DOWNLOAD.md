Pre-built apps for **iOS**, **Android**, and **HarmonyOS** are listed below. All three apps run the MiniCPM-V multimodal model fully **on-device** via `llama.cpp` — no remote server, no data leaves your phone.

## 🍎 iOS — TestFlight

**Public TestFlight link:** [https://testflight.apple.com/join/yNKyFZwW](https://testflight.apple.com/join/yNKyFZwW)

> **NOTE:** iOS ships slower than Android / HarmonyOS. Every iOS build must clear Apple's TestFlight review before reaching users, so new features and bug fixes on iOS typically land **several days to a couple of weeks behind** the Android APK and HarmonyOS HAP releases. If you need the latest fix immediately, please use the Android or HarmonyOS package on this page.

### Requirements

- iPhone or iPad running **iOS / iPadOS 16 or later**
- Device with **≥ 6 GB RAM** recommended (e.g. iPhone 15 Pro, or iPad with an M-series chip) for smooth on-device inference
- The [TestFlight](https://apps.apple.com/app/testflight/id899247664) app installed from the App Store

### How to install

1. Install **TestFlight** from the App Store on your iPhone or iPad.
2. Open the public link above on the same device, then tap **Accept** → **Install**.
3. Launch **MiniCPM-V Demo** from the Home Screen and follow the in-app prompts to download the model files.

> Each TestFlight build is valid for up to 90 days. When a new build is published, TestFlight will notify you automatically.
