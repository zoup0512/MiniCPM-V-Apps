/**
 * Metadata for a downloadable MiniCPM-V variant.
 *
 * Two download strategies are supported, in priority order:
 *
 * 1. **Direct URL** ([directGgufUrl] / [directMmprojUrl]) — used as-is. This is
 *    how the iOS demo handles MiniCPM-V-4.6 today: the GGUFs are not yet on
 *    HuggingFace, so a temporary OSS link (Huawei Cloud OBS) is used during
 *    the TestFlight period. Whenever both direct URLs are non-null, HF/MS are
 *    skipped entirely.
 *
 * 2. **HuggingFace + ModelScope fallback** ([hfRepo] / [msRepo]) — the
 *    standard path for already-published models such as MiniCPM-V-4.0.
 *    The downloader probes HF first and falls back to ModelScope on failure.
 *
 * When [ggufMd5] / [mmprojMd5] are provided, the downloader verifies the
 * downloaded file's MD5 and deletes + raises on mismatch. Mirrors iOS demo
 * MBV4ModelDownloadManager / MBV46ModelDownloadManager behaviour.
